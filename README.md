Ignotis 'Nauts AIs
==================
This repository contains the files for all of my Awesomenauts AIs, as well as
changelogs, releases, and build scripts. If you have a suggestion or found
a bug, please make an [issue](https://github.com/dillmo/Ignotis-Nauts-AIs/issues).

Brainy Voltar
-------------
BrainyVoltar is a Voltar AI that focuses primarily on support efforts, such as
healing. It should be noted that this does not hinder his effectiveness.
Instead, it improves it. Voltar will only follow around low-health allies until
they are healed. Otherwise, he focuses on pushing droid waves. If the enemy
team is not careful, he can easily push into their base in a few minutes.
Additionally, BrainyVoltar is very careful. He will not attempt to chase down
an enemy unless he is confident he can kill or nearly kill him. He will also
use healbot both defensively and offensively, for pushing and team fights. He
can use Suicide Drones defensively as well.

This makes for a very effective Voltar AI. As is typical for Voltar players, he
will start of slow, but leapfrog his allies by about 300 solar by midgame. By
lategame, he starts racking up kills, even to the point of becoming a Killing
Machine.

**Pros:**
* Tries to stay behind and heal droids on his team while pushing. This tactic
  works *really* well)
* Heals nearby team members with the lowest health.
* Attacks enemies with suicide drones when in trouble.
* Places healbot intelligently.
* Places healbot next to enemy turrets when droids are attacking them for
  longer pushes.
* Gets lots of solar from healing, so he can upgrade quickly.
* Targets and follows teammates very effectively.
* Uses Suicide Drones intelligently.
* Very cautious, preventing lots of deaths.

**Cons:**
* Doesn't regroup with allies when he is caught alone. Instead, he just stays
  outside of the enemy's range.

Super Sentry
------------
Super Sentry is a Sentry X-58 AI designed to take advantage of Sentry-X58's
affinities. He tries to use his Photon Mine ability for area control, to tank
for his allies, and to use Black Hole Sun to escape and secure kills.
